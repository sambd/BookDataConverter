# Book Data Converter

It will convert book information of one text format to another text format. Book of data is in plain text or in json format. It takes input of a file name & it has also a configuration file (**book-info-converter.properties**) where user can set the target text format. In **resource** folder, I stored some sample input files in both format. Run **BookDataConvert.java** file.

You can also add lots of white space & blank space into the input file format like (in **resouce** folder--> **textInput1.txt**, **jsonInput1.txt**)
